The developed PBPK model of moclobemide describes the observed concentration-time courses very well.

As most of the  non-CYP2C19 metabolism is via FMO3 which is mainly expressed in the liver, non-CYP2C19 CL is modeled in the liver only.

Given not enough data to evaluate inhibition of emerging moclobemide metabolites, auto-inhibition of moclobemide appears appropriate approximation.
