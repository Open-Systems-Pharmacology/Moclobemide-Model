The presented PBPK model of moclobemide has been developed to be used in a PBPK Drug-Drug-Interactions (DDI) network with moclobemide as a substrate and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19.

Moclobemide is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), a drug primarily used to treat depression and social anxiety ([Mayersohn 1995](#5-references)). Moclobemide pharmacokinetics is characterized by non-linearity in dose and time. Cmax concentrations decrease with dose for doses above 100 mg. Furthermore, a saturation in clearance at higher doses (200 mg and up) could be seen, as indicated by a longer terminal phase. In addition, multiple doses administration resulted in higher moclobemide concentrations compared to single dose. This could be indicative of the previously reported auto-inhibitory effect ([Nair 1993](#5-references)).

**Absorption**: Moclobemide is highly soluble, and consequently fast and completely absorbed. Absolute bioavailability has been reported to be dependent on the dose, likely due to saturable (first-pass) metabolism ([Mayersohn 1995](#5-references)).

**Distribution**: Moclobemide is moderately bound to plasma proteins and due to its lipophilicity distributes widely in the body (Vss ~ 1.2 L/kg) ([MHRA Label Moclobemide](#5-references)).

**Metabolism**: About 99% of a dose is metabolized mainly via CYP2C19 (C-oxidation, producing metabolite RO12-8095) and FMO3 (N-oxidation, producing metabolite RO12-5637) ([Gram 1995](#5-references), [Hoskins 2001](#5-references), [Mayersohn 1995](#5-references)).

**Excretion**: Less than 1% of a dose is excreted unchanged via the kidneys.
